# numeronym

Turn your text into numeronyms (e.g. internalization becomes i18n, since there are 18 letters in the word between i and n).

Inspired by a tweet where I saw someone say "Marc A8n", made in 24 minutes (including manually initializing a Next.js project and git repo, looking up whether I should run `npm run dev` or `npm run start`, and failing to deploy on Netlify because I don't know what the default output directory is called.)
