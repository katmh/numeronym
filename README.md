# numeronym

Turn your text into numeronyms (e.g. internalization becomes i18n, since there are 18 letters in the word between i and n).

Inspired by a tweet where I saw someone say "Marc A8n", made in 24 minutes, a process that included:

- Looking up existing numeronym generators, not immediately seeing any that returned instant numeronym-ed text
- `npm init`, installing Next and React, `git init`
- Looking up whether I should run `npm run dev` or `npm run start`
- Failing to deploy on Netlify because I don't know what the default output directory is called, using Vercel instead
